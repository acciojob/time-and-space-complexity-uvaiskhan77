	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity-The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. , efficient-The time complexity of a code can greatly impact its efficiency and scalability. A code with a lower time complexity will generally perform better than a code with a higher time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity-Amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of the size of the input, O(n)</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity-Amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of the size of the input,</b></p>
